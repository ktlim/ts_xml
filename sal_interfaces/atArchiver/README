# AtArchiver Device 

atArchiver device acts like a regular archiver with the same commands and events but those messages have to come from different topics so that OCS can bring up/tear down atArchiver as a separate CSC. 

As of this moment, atArchiver does not have specialized commands/events. 

# INSTALLATION 

Comment out `SYSDC (atArchiver, hasGenerics) 1` in add_system_dictionary.tcl. That will make atArchiver use generic commands/events.
